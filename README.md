# website

To get started:

- Clone the gh-pages branch to a directory called website
- Clone the master branch to a directory called website-master
- Make development changes in the master branch
- Delete the contents of the website folder (except the .git directory)
- Run the builder application from the master branch and this will create the output in the gh-pages branch folder
- Commit the changes to the gh-pages branch
